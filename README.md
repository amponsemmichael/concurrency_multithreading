# Concurrency and Multithreading

This repository contains examples and explanations of advanced Java topics related to concurrency and multithreading. It covers the following key areas:

## Table of Contents
1. [Concurrency](#concurrency)
2. [Multithreading](#multithreading)
3. [Thread Control and Deadlocks](#thread-control-and-deadlocks)
4. [Synchronization](#synchronization)
5. [Producer-Consumer Pattern](#producer-consumer-pattern)

## Concurrency

Concurrency in Java refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. This section covers:

- Fundamentals of concurrent programming
- Java's concurrency API
- Concurrent collections
- Executors and thread pools
- Future and CompletableFuture

[View Concurrency Examples](./src/concurrency)

## Multithreading

Multithreading allows a program to run multiple threads concurrently. This section includes:

- Creating and managing threads
- Runnable and Callable interfaces
- Thread lifecycle and states
- Thread priorities and scheduling

[View Multithreading Examples](./src/multithreading)

## Thread Control and Deadlocks

Understanding thread control and avoiding deadlocks is crucial in concurrent programming. Topics covered:

- Thread coordination (join, wait, notify)
- Deadlock detection and prevention
- Livelock and starvation
- Thread interruption

[View Thread Control Examples](./src/threadcontrol)

## Synchronization

Synchronization is essential for managing shared resources in a multithreaded environment. This section covers:

- Synchronized methods and blocks
- Volatile keyword
- Atomic variables
- Lock interface and implementations
- Read-write locks

[View Synchronization Examples](./src/synchronization)

## Producer-Consumer Pattern

The Producer-Consumer pattern is a classic concurrency design pattern. This section includes:

- Implementation using wait() and notify()
- Using BlockingQueue
- Semaphore-based implementation
- Comparison of different approaches
